# Which framework builtin mod packages a runtime target stages.
#
# Every builtin under mods/builtin/packages targets game_id "*", so by default
# every title ships every one of them. A title may decline one it does not
# want -- because it ships its own replacement (WipEout 3's team-mark bezel
# supersedes the generic file-picker bezel) or because the feature is wrong for
# it -- by naming the package in EXCLUDE_BUILTIN_MODS on
# psxrecomp_add_runtime_target() / psxrecomp_add_game_runtime().
#
# Internal Resolution is required shared UI: legacy allowlists include it,
# and an exclusion or title-local override of its id fails configure.
#
# An excluded package is ABSENT, not hidden: it is never copied into
# <exe-dir>/mods/bundled, so the launcher cannot list it, no release packager
# can ship it, and a stale state.toml naming it has nothing to reach.
#
# Kept in its own file, with no project-mode commands, so that
# runtime/tests/test_mod_catalog_layout.py can drive the real selection logic
# through `cmake -P` without configuring a whole runtime.

#     [TITLE     <ids>...] # the target's own PRELOADED_MODS_DIR package ids
# )
#
# Fails configure loudly on:
#   * an excluded id that is not a framework builtin (a typo would otherwise
#     leave the package shipping while the CMakeLists reads as if it did not);
#   * an excluded id the title's own catalog also provides (a title catalog may
#     OVERRIDE a builtin at the same id -- excluding and overriding the same id
#     at once contradicts itself, and either reading would surprise someone).

# psxrecomp_add_game_runtime() parses EXCLUDE_BUILTIN_MODS as a multi-value
# argument but forwards keywords it does not know (GAME_OVERLAY_STATIC_C,
# APP_ICON, ...) to psxrecomp_add_runtime_target(). cmake_parse_arguments keeps
# collecting a multi-value list until it meets one of ITS OWN keywords, so a
# forwarded keyword written after EXCLUDE_BUILTIN_MODS -- and its value -- would
# be swallowed as package ids. Package ids are lower-case dotted names, never
# an upper-case keyword, so everything from the first keyword-shaped token on
# is handed back as the tail to forward.
