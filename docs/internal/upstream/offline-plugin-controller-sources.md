Original author: Yves <calibratedbeats@gmail.com>. The feature commit retains
that exact human author identity. The focused port consolidates the selected
source hunks and corrections. Its commit also cites these sources and carries
the original human contributor's `Co-authored-by: Yves <calibratedbeats@gmail.com>` trailer.

Adapted: Only trusted controller-source registration, validation/neutralization and the existing offline host-input boundary.

Deliberately excluded: OpenXR Touch action implementation, game bindings/deadzones/aiming and guest SIO replacements.

The feature was reconstructed on upstream master
`db62eec15f81c88aef3d6dab51d4e566a7167d23`, retaining current upstream APIs,
renderer/input policy and build integration. Validation after reconstruction:
Absent/invalid/declined/analog/digital source, detach and session-reset executable checks.

The motivating consumer is [Medal of Honor, SLUS-00974 (NTSC-U)](https://github.com/FractalEngineer/Medal-Of-Honor-PSX-Recomp/tree/e323885958c2ae0b0df847bed6175f9e76524442).
Game-specific integration remains in that repository. Consuming this change
requires a deliberate framework pin update in the game repo and a rebuild.
This is a host/runtime/tool change; it requires no BIOS or game C regeneration.

Historical alpha acceptance used the older framework checkpoint above. It is
separate from current-master branch verification. Fresh game, renderer and
headset checks, where applicable, are recorded in the PR validation notes;
uncertain hardware/runtime behavior must not be inferred from a clean link.

## Current-master integration validation

Windows, GCC 13.2, Ninja, Release. Runtime test checks remain active with NDEBUG enabled.

Release controller-source checks pass for absent, invalid, declined, analog/digital, detach and session-reset samples; they remain active with NDEBUG enabled. Integrated flat input reaches gameplay. Hardware controller mappings and live headset focus/reconnect behavior remain outside this test coverage.

Integration: [Medal of Honor, SLUS-00974 NTSC-U](https://github.com/FractalEngineer/Medal-Of-Honor-PSX-Recomp/tree/e323885958c2ae0b0df847bed6175f9e76524442), built against the corrected framework stack with `PSXRECOMP_ROOT`. Bundled OpenBIOS LLE cold boot, menu navigation, mission gameplay, fresh savestate creation/loading and post-load input/frame advancement were checked with screenshots. An older alpha slot-5 savestate was refused; compatibility with historical states is not established. Memory-card round trips, attract-demo completion, other games and fresh headset visuals were not tested.

The registered recompiler suite reports 132 passes, four failures and three disabled tests. The four failures reproduce on unchanged upstream master in this Windows toolchain: `portable_settings_paths_test`, `optional_netplay_auth`, `compile_overlays_static_tail` and `aot_overlay_discovery`. The introduced BIOS-fingerprint and GL-guard failures are fixed.
